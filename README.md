# hello-world
Hello this is a test.
I'm a 28 year old Psychologist and Professional Hipnotist. Even tho I love being a mental health professional, I don't think this define me at all. I'm a super fun, curious, artistic and unique person (at least that's what I think I am) and I do not psychoanalize people all the time... I born in Guatemala and grew up in Guatemala as well. I don't know what my roots are but I hope someday I could find it.

I think Psychology and Hypnosis is great to learn but not so great when you have to work as a therapist. That's why I decided to learn some coding and tech things so I can work as something else. My first language is Spanish so please don't judge my English :P
